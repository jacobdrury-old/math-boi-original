# Math Boi

This discord.js bot was developed to assit with running my Discord Server, Optimal Learning. Math Boi assists with assigning roles to users, providing a mod mail system for users to report issues to the staff team, continually monitoring messages sent to auto delete.

# Features

-   Role selection menu
-   Welcome messages
-   Modmail
-   Mod Logs (Separate channels for User, Message, Moderation, Join/Leave Logs)
-   Auto scans all messages for key words to auto delete
-   Disboard Auto Bump Remind
-   And a bunch more that I'm forgetting. ;)

# Info

As stated in the intro, this was designed specifically for my Discord server. Therefore it would require some alterations to suit your own server's needs. I do not plan to offer any support or resolve any of the outstanding issues in this repo. Feel free to fork and resolve any if you so desire to use this project for your own server. It is written in discord.js and uses MongoDB to store all the data.
